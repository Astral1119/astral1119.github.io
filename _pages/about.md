<p>Hey! I'm Astral, a 17 year old from the United States who really likes working with spreadsheets. I specialize in Google Sheets formulae and novel bug uses.</p>

<p>I started using Google Sheets in April of 2022. I'd been helping design <a href="https://spellchess.io/">Spellchess</a>, and I'd wanted to compile community suggestions in a spreadsheet. One of the things I'd wanted to do was aggregate comments, something that was very difficult prior to the addition of <a href ="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12508718">LAMBDA</a> in August 2022. After stumbling around for answers, I came across the <a href="https://discord.gg/M9GKpPd">Spreadsheets Discord Community</a>, where I am most active. In January of 2023, I was promoted to a moderator.</p>
  
<p>My interests over time have also evolved. From community assistance to bug hunting to LAMBDAless to algorithmic LAMBDAs, I've found that spreadsheets are powerful, versatile, and accessible. I hope you'll join me in my spreadsheeting journey!</p>
